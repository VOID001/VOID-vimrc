###How-to-Guide

* First change to your .vim directory and make a dir named 'bundle'
* Then exec this command `git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim`
* Then put replace your .vimrc file with the .vimrc file in my repo ~ 
* Then open a new vim editor and enter `:PluginInstall` __make sure you have network connection enabled__
* After this all the plugins except Ycm should work well 
* YCM should be compiled first, to compile YCM, just cd to `~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe/` then run `/path/to/your/python2 install.py --clang-completer` 
* Then if you want to enable Ycm just put a .ycm_extra_conf.py in your current directory , or in any father directory, Here is a .ycm_extra_conf.py for C++ use (in this repo)
* And feel free to hack on it ~ !
